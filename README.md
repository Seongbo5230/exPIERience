# exPIERience
The name of this project is called “exPIERience” and the technological field of focus is virtual reality. We will be working on creating a virtual reality experience using the Oculus Rift for the Center of Coastal Marine Sciences (CCMS). The purpose of this system is to enable people to experience diving at the Cal Poly Pier even during nonoptimal diving conditions which occur frequently. CCMS hopes to attract further interest and possible momentum in future outreach such as a “Live Dive” program, where live videos of divers under the pier can be streamed. A 360° video from the diver’s perspective will be recorded during the diver’s journey through the water. These captured images will be recreated into a 3D space that will simulate an experience as if the user of the headset is the actual diver. We will need to build a camera system that will properly record an entire 360° view of the space that the diver experiences first hand. In addition to this system, an easy-to use control system must be built for proper navigation throughout the 3D space. We hope to deliver a design that will enable users of all expertise to operate the device and have the same user experience.
